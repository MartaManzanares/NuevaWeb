# NuevaWeb
The HTML project is based on the creation of a very simple web site structurally speaking, with information about the city of Salamanca, aimed at an audience that wishes to visit this city. The website consists of recommendations of places, places to go out and gastronomic information.
The project in terms of information deals with cultural characteristics of the city of Salamanca. Dealing with topics such as places you should visit if you go, its gastronomic culture and recommended restaurants to go to and places to party. In addition, a brief summary of the city is made.

## General Information
The cultural characteristics of the city of Salamanca are based on recommendations from the "Salmantinos" themselves. The website is created in a format where the information can be concise and does not exceed basic recommendations that are more attractive to the reader. For possible future collaborators, it would be good to create new sections with recommendations for places to stay or cheap trips out of the city. Although it is also worth mentioning that the format already stated above should be followed.

## Structure
The external structure is well differentiated thanks to its conciseness. The page is a microsite that consists of a main page and a small index on the left that remains constant throughout the website. If you click on it, it redirects you to the selected section, although you can also access it by scrolling the screen. The index is made up of 4 sections: gastronomic experiences, night-life, what to visit? and contact. Contact is designed so that anyone interested can leave us their name and email along with suggestions to improve the website or possible questions.
As for the internal structure of the project, it is made with Visual Studio Code, and consists of 5 sections: css, images, public, LICENSE and README.md.
- In the README.md we are making a description of the project. This section is necessary and important due to its usefulness for potential collaborators since it explains the implementation of the project outside of its execution and programming. This way, for example if it were an open project, they could follow the project appropriately.
- The LICENSE provides a detailed presentation of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE in Version 3, created on June 29, 2007. This section is also mandatory since it explains the terms and conditions of use of the system.
- In images the photos that are established on the website are placed. It is also not entirely necessary since it could be included in the index directly, but it significantly improves the organization.
- css(Cascading Style Sheets) has a subsection called styles.css. where we control the functionalities and design of our website, such as the colors, the layout of the structure or the size of the sections. As in the previous section, it could be included in the index, but it would lose a lot of clarity in the project and could cause confusion that can be avoided by using this good practice.
- Finally in public, we have another subsection, index.html. All the program information and the different HTML elements are available here, including text or links, elements that allow a user to interact with the web.

## Project status
The status of the project is finished, modifications could be made but it is a simple website that does not need anything else. For potential collaborators, it would be enough to add new sections to the external structure of the program.

## Technologies
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Version 1.84 
* [Git Hub](https://github.com/): Version 2.42.0.windows.2

## Problems
The main work problems during the creation have mainly been due to the downloading of a template for use, because the extent of the information on it has been more extensive than the capacity of a novice in terms of creating web pages. . I had commands that we had not given and the time spent on it has been long. Although as I have already said, time spent is clearly the only solution to the problem.
Another problem was the creation of the CSS, since when I saved the CSS of the template and transposed it into the style, the website changed its design radically and did not pay attention to the CSS guidelines. Although after a long time of seeing the error, I managed to fix it, apart from the fact that changing the prewritten lines was not difficult for me (this to change its design).
Finally, and the problem that took the most time for me was creating a new repository to work on in Visual Studio Code. Although we had instructions on how to do it and we had already done it before in class. It took him some time to figure out how he could create a new one, plus he didn't understand how to link it to the template, although like everything, he solved it over time. 

## Conclusions
The project, despite its adversities, has turned out well and has everything necessary to make the page readable, beautiful and well structured. The aforementioned problems could be solved with more practice in terms of web designs and information on the different websites and methodologies that can be used, which can be achieved with experience and practice in the future.
The website could be improved with the help of other collaborators with more knowledge in the different areas of design or programming, although the website is really designed practically and without errors.
