                <p>The double degree in business analytics and computer engineering (bilingual) offered at the
                    Francisco de Vitoria University consists of the education of both areas. business analytics
                    teaches how to analyze information and data from different institutions both
                    public and private, such as financial or marketing in this business aspect.
                    While computer engineering provides competencies about the branch of engineering
                    of computer science. The degree is 4 years in both careers, while the double
                    There are 5, dedicating this last year solely to computer engineering. In the first
                    semester of the 1st year (in which I am studying), we have 8 subjects. Those of
                    computer engineering are Mathematics for Engineering 1, Introduction to programming and
                    Fundamentals of Computer Engineering, which we will talk about later. And in the part of
                    Business Analytics we have, Introduction to Big Data and data management, History of
                    science and technology, Organization and Administration of
                    companies 1 and Microeconomics. Some of them in English as it is a bilingual degree. Finally
                    This is the subject of Personal Skills and Competencies, which is mandatory for all
                    the races. If you are looking for more information about the double degree schedule, click on the

                    This page is a basic training subject in which the student is introduced to the
                    basic principles of Computational Engineering to have a global vision and perspective in
                    areas such as mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics. In the case of students who
                    They study this degree at Francisco de Vitoria, the teacher in question is Moisés Martínez Muñoz.
